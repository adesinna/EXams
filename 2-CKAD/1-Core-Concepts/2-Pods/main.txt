A pod is the basic execution unit of a k8 application. Kubernetes manages the pods instead of a container.

Pods provide all the resources a container needs to run. Containers live inside a pod.

Most time there is always one container in the pod there could be multi container or an init container in
the pod, which is not very common.


kubectl create of pd.yaml

kubectl get pods

kubectl describe pod name_of_pod

kubectl get nodes # gets the nodes

kubectl describe node name_of_node # this has to do with nodes

kubectl get pods -o wide # gives more details than just get pods, this will show the nodes where the pods are running


Debugging Pods:
    ImagePullBackOff: It means you specific the wrong image

    CrashLoopBackOff


kubectl logs name_of_pod # to see the logs in the pod container

kubectl logs -f name_of_pod # would see the log dynamically



kubectl run nginx --image nginx # this creates a pod

kubectl exec -it pod_name -- /bin/bash


kubectl run name_of_pod --image=image_name


kubectl run name_of_pod --image=image_name  --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml
