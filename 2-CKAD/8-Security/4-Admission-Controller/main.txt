You use kubeconfig to authenticate and RBAC to authorize what the users can do, but
this is only based on the kube-api level, i.e get, list and get.

For example, if a pod is created and you do not want to allow images from a public
registry, RBAC cannot achieve this.

Admission Controller helps to implement more security measures in the cluster.

We have some admission controller like that comes default

- AlwaysPullImages
    This ensures everytime a pod is created images are always pulled from registry

- DefaultStorageClass
    This would automatically add  the default storage class to the pvc

- EvenRateLimit
    This helps limit the request to the api server so as not to overwhelm it

- NamespaceExists
    Reject request to namespace that does not exist


sudo vim /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml and do not apply tghe file since it is a static pod

Check for admission controller

You add and disable addmission control using the enable and disable flag


kube-apiserver -h | grep -i enable-admission-plugins


Mutating Admission Controller

    This can change or mutate the object before creating it, a good example
    of this is the DefaultStorageClass admission controller, it would add
    storage class directly to a pvc that storage class is not provided

Validating Admission Controller
    This one allows or deny a request, example is NamespaceExists



They are admission controller that can do both, however, it goes through mutating
first before validating
