API groups in Kubernetes are a way to organize and version resources in the Kubernetes API.
They help manage the evolution of the Kubernetes API over time while ensuring backward compatibility.
API groups allow Kubernetes to expose multiple APIs for different functionalities
and enable developers to add their own APIs or extensions.



1. Core API Group:

    Also called the "legacy" API group.
    Does not have a group name; resources in this group are directly accessible under paths like /api/v1.
    Includes basic Kubernetes objects such as:
       Pods
       Services
       ConfigMaps
       PersistentVolumes
       Secrets
       Namespaces

2. Named API Groups
 Extend the Kubernetes API to include more functionality or specific features.
 Follow the format <groupName>/<version>, e.g., apps/v1.
 Examples of named API groups:
   apps (e.g., Deployments, DaemonSets, StatefulSets)
   batch (e.g., Jobs, CronJobs)
   autoscaling (e.g., HorizontalPodAutoscaler)
   policy (e.g., PodSecurityPolicy)
   rbac.authorization.k8s.io (e.g., Role, RoleBinding, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding)
   networking.k8s.io (e.g., NetworkPolicy, Ingress)
   apiextensions.k8s.io (e.g., CustomResourceDefinition)


3. Custom API Groups
 Developers can define their own APIs using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
 CRDs allow the creation of custom resources, which can be grouped under custom API groups.



Versioning
API groups support multiple versions (e.g., v1, v1beta1, v2alpha1) to enable gradual evolution:
 Alpha: Experimental and may change or be removed. Not recommended for production.
 Beta: More stable but may still have breaking changes. Suitable for testing.
 Stable (v1): Productionready and backwardcompatible.

Discovery
API groups are discoverable via the Kubernetes API server. You can list the available API groups by running:
bash
kubectl apiversions


Or to get detailed API resources within a specific group:
bash
kubectl apiresources


 Practical Use
 When working with Kubernetes objects, you specify the group and version explicitly in manifests, such as:
yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: exampledeployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: example
    spec:
      containers:
       name: examplecontainer
        image: nginx


API groups provide structure, modularity, and scalability for the Kubernetes API, accommodating both core and extensible resources.
