A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is a workload API object used to manage stateful applications.
Unlike Deployments, which are suited for stateless applications.
StatefulSets are designed to manage the deployment and scaling of a set of pods
with guaranteed ordering, uniqueness, and persistent storage.


Key Features of StatefulSets

Stable Identifiers:
    Each pod in a StatefulSet gets a stable and unique name.
    For example, if the StatefulSet is named mysql, the pods will be named mysql-0, mysql-1, etc.

Stable Storage:
    Each pod is associated with a PersistentVolume (PV) that retains data across pod restarts.

Ordered Deployment and Scaling:
    Pods are created in order (mysql-0, mysql-1, etc.).
    Pods are terminated in reverse order.

Ordered Updates:
    StatefulSets ensure updates are applied sequentially, pod by pod.

Network Identity:
    Each pod gets a stable network identity (DNS) based on its name.
    This allows applications like MySQL to form clusters or master-slave configurations reliably.
