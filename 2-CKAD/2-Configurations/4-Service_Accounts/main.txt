There are two types of accounts that you can use to access the cluster,
see it as a gmail account

i. User accounts # this is use by humans
ii. Service accounts # This is used by bots and machine

Service account is what bot uses to authenticate to the k8 cluster.
Whenever a service account is created, a token is also create as a secret object that is associated with it,
this is what the external application will use to do the authentication to the k8 cluster.

If the 3rd party application is also in the cluster, i.e running as a pod, the token would mounted as a volume.


kubectl get sa

kubectl describe sa name_of_sa

kubectl get seceret sa_token-kbbdm # this is the token it secreted

If the 3rd party application is on the cluster too, you can mount the secret as a volume


Every pod in a namespace have a default sa mounted on it so it can run

To add service account in the deployment spec

serviceAccountName: dashboard-sa
