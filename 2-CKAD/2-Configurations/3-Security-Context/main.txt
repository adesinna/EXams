In Kubernetes, a securityContext defines security settings for Pods or Containers to enhance isolation and restrict privileges.

Pod-level securityContext applies to all containers in a Pod, setting defaults like
user ID (runAsUser), group ID (runAsGroup), file group permissions (fsGroup),
or enforcing non-root execution (runAsNonRoot).
For example, you can specify all containers in a Pod run as a non-root user.

Container-level securityContext allows fine-grained security controls for individual containers,
overriding Pod-level settings. Examples include enabling a read-only root filesystem (readOnlyRootFilesystem),
managing Linux capabilities (capabilities), or disallowing privilege escalation (allowPrivilegeEscalation).

By combining Pod and container securityContext, you can enforce security policies globally for
the Pod while tailoring restrictions for specific containers.
This approach minimizes risks by adhering to the principle of least privilege,
preventing unnecessary host access or elevated permissions.
Proper configuration protects workloads and reduces vulnerabilities.
