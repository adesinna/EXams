AWS offers several types of load balancers under its Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service,
each designed to handle different types of traffic and workloads.


 1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
    Layer: Operates at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model.
    Use Case:
      Ideal for load balancing HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
      It supports advanced routing mechanisms, such as host based routing,
      path based routing, and routing based on HTTP headers.

    Features:
      Supports WebSocket and HTTP/S.
      Provides contentbased routing, making it suitable for microservices and containerized applications.
      Integration with AWS services like AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) for security.
      Target groups can include EC2 instances, IP addresses, and Lambda functions.

 2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)
        Layer: Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer).
        Use Case:
            Designed for load balancing TCP, UDP, and TLS traffic where performance is critical.
            It's ideal for applications that require extreme performance and low latency.

        Features:
          Capable of handling millions of requests per second with ultra-low latencies.
          Provides static IP addresses per availability zone and supports Elastic IP addresses.
          Preserves the source IP of the client, which is crucial for certain applications.

 3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)
    Layer: Can operate at both Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 7 (Application Layer),
            but with limited features compared to ALB and NLB.

    Use Case:
            Traditional load balancer suitable for simple load balancing of HTTP/HTTPS or TCP traffic.
            It is now considered legacy and is generally recommended only for existing applications already using it.

    Features:
      Supports both SSL termination and sticky sessions.
      Limited to basic routing, making it less versatile than ALB or NLB.

 4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)
    Layer: Operates at Layer 3 (Network Layer).
    Use Case: Ideal for deploying, scaling, and managing virtual appliances, such as firewalls,
              intrusion detection systems, and deep packet inspection systems.
    Features:
      Integrates with third party network virtual appliances.
      Allows inspection of traffic at scale without needing to update the client or service configurations.
      Provides a single entry and exit point for traffic and seamlessly redirects traffic to the virtual appliances.

 Key Differences and Considerations:
     ALB is optimal for web applications needing advanced routing features, such as path based or host based routing.
     NLB is the goto choice for high performance applications requiring low latency and the ability to handle volatile traffic patterns.
     CLB is suitable for older applications but is generally being phased out in favor of ALB and NLB.
     GWLB is specialized for integrating virtual appliances and offers unique networking capabilities.

Each load balancer type supports health checks, automatic scaling, and integration with other AWS services,
but your choice should depend on your application's specific needs and the type of traffic you expect to handle.
