VPC is a virtual private cloud. This is the logical isolation of your resource network on the cloud.
In GCP, VPC is a global resource, and you can create subnets in regions. Unlike AWS, if firewalls rules allows it, they
can communicate privately since they use their fibre optics.

Public Subnets:
Resources can be exposed to the internet, and they are meant to be exposed. Example is application load balancer.

Private Subnets:
They can do not need to be exposed to the internet.


Modes of VPC
Auto mode:
You get subnets in all region, when you create the vpc

Custom mode:
You will have to create your own subnets in the region you want



When you enable private google access, then you VM's can connect to google's api via private subnets. To see the
logs in the VPC you should enable FLOW LOGS


CIDR:
These are continuous IP addresses to make routing easier.
 172.9.0.0/X     # to know the number of ips.  2 ^ 32-X
    0 8 16 24

Firewall Rules:
These are the security groups for your instances running. You can allow but ingress and egress rules. They are stateful,
that is if ingress is allowed, then it implies egress is automatically allowed.
They have priorities, 0 is the highest
