A load balancer allows you to distribute loads to your backend instances across zones and regions.
It can be configured with health check, so it does not route traffic to the unhealthy ones.


Anycast IP is a networking technique where the same IP address is assigned to multiple servers or routers,
and traffic is automatically routed to the nearest or best-performing one based on routing metrics.
