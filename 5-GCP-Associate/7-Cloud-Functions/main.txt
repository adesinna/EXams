Cloud Functions allows you to execute your codes when an event happens.
You only pay for the amount of cpu, memory and request. It is fully serverless. It is time bound 1min to max 60min

Cloud Functions is a serverless platform that runs single-purpose, event-driven functions in response to triggers,
without managing servers or containers.

Example

HTTP-triggered Python function:

def hello_world(request):
    return "Hello from Cloud Functions!"


Deploy:

gcloud functions deploy hello_world \
    --runtime python311 \
    --trigger-http \
    --allow-unauthenticated




Cloud Functions automatically creates the endpoint, scales it, and runs your code — you don’t need to manage servers or containers.


Flow of an HTTP-triggered Cloud Function

You deploy the function:

gcloud functions deploy hello_world \
    --runtime python311 \
    --trigger-http \
    --allow-unauthenticated


Google Cloud automatically gives it an HTTPS endpoint, like:

https://REGION-PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/hello_world


Client sends an HTTP request (GET/POST/etc.) to that URL.

Google Cloud receives the request and routes it to your function.

Cloud Functions runtime starts your function (if no instance is running, it will cold-start a container):

def hello_world(request):
    return "Hello from Cloud Functions!"


Function executes your code and returns a response.

Cloud Functions scales automatically:

Handles multiple concurrent requests by spinning up more instances

Scales down to 0 when idle
