They are several ways you can optimize cost when using GCP VMs

Sustained use discount:
    This is a discount that is applied for running the VM for significant portion of the month

Committed use discount:
For workloads with predictable resource needs, you would need to commit to 1 or 3 years. You can get up to 70% discount
on your vms. And this apply to GKE too. Commited to the base nodes and any extra created by auto scaling can be billed
as standard.

GCP Preemptible VM Recap:

Cheap, short-lived VM (up to 24 hours), Can be terminated at any time if GCP needs the resources, ~70–80% cheaper than regular VMs
Good for batch jobs, stateless workloads, or flexible compute.



You can also create a budget to know when the cost passes a specific amount, it is a billing alerts.


Live Migration and Availability Policy:
How do you keep you vm running even if you need to make update.

Live Migration:
    The running instance is migrated to another host in the same zone, does not change any attributes of the VMs, it
    is not supported for GPUs abd Preemptible instances.

Availability Policy:
    This is where you configure you migration

    On host maintenance:
        What should happend during periodic infrastructure maintenance
        1. Migrate to another host
        2. Terminate the instance

        3. Restart instance if it is a non user intiated reasons
