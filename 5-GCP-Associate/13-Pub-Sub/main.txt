Suppose you have an application that writes synchronously into a logging application, if the logging service goes down,
it might affect your application. If there is high load, and there is a lot of logs coming in.
This is when asynchronous communication works well.

You can create a topic in pub-sub, the app publish to the topic, the calls are queued in the topics, and the logging
service subscribes to them when ready.
