Compute engines are virtual machines running on the cloud.
It allows you to
1. Create and manage the life cycle of your VM
2. Load balancing and auto-scaling of your VM
3. Attach storage and network storage to your VM
4. Manage network connectivity and configurations of your VMS

Compute Engine Machine  in GCP

General Purpose:
    This is great for general purpose workloads, like Web and application servers

Memory Optimized:
    This is great for memory intensive workloads, like In memory analytics applications or caching applications

Computer Optimized:
    This is great for compute intensive workloads like gaming applications

Storage Optimized:
    This is great for storage intensive workloads like Databases

Network Optimized:
    This is great for low latency work

GPU:
    This is great for parallel processing example is ML training workloads



Image:
    This is the OS and Software you want on your VM, it could be public or custom images

Public and Private IP
The internal ip is used within the subnet while external is for communicating over the internet.

When you stop a vm and start it again, it gives it a new external ip.

If you need to make sure to make the vm has a constant external ip, use static ip address, so when you restart
you would still have your ip address.



Custom Image:
What it is:
A snapshot of a disk (OS + installed software + configuration). like httpd installed already

What it does:
 Lets you create new VMs with the same OS and preinstalled software.

What it doesn’t do:

Doesn’t define machine type, network, tags, startup scripts, or metadata.

Equivalent in AWS: AMI

A GCP custom image captures whatever is on the VM disk.
If you installed httpd before creating the image, it’s included; if not, it isn’t.

GCP Instance Template

What it is: A full blueprint for launching a VM.

What it can define:

    Boot disk (can use a custom image)

    Machine type

    Network/subnet

    Tags

    Service accounts

    Metadata / startup scripts

What it’s good for:

Auto-scaling groups (managed instance groups)

Quickly launching multiple identical VMs

Equivalent in AWS: Launch Template
