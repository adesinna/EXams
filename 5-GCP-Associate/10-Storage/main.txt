We have 3 types of storage
1. Block Storage
2. File Storage
3. Object Storage


1. Block Storage:
These are hard disk attached to your instances of the network. They store data in chunks of small block in memory, each
block of data can be individually managed.
There is typically a  1 to 1 relationship between VM and a block storage. However, if you have multiple VM and you want
them to share a single block storage, they must be doing only reads operations to the block storage.
It is very possible to connect multiple block storage to 1 single VM.

Persistent Disk in GCP
    i. Zonal and Regional
    ii. Network Storage
Local SSDs
    i. Physically attached to your VM, and lasts the lifecycle of the VM.
    ii. High IOPS and low latency




2. File Storage:
The data is organized in a folder and files like structure, it is best when a shared file is accessed by multiple systems
These are used in legacy apps that uses file system. Multiple VMs doing a multiple reads and writes.

In GCP it is called File Store
