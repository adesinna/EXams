loud Run is a fully-managed, serverless compute platform from Google Cloud that runs containerized applications and
automatically handles infrastructure, scaling, and networking so you only focus on your code.


Cloud Run lets you:

Package your app into a Docker container

Deploy it with one command

Google automatically:

Runs it

Scales it up when there’s traffic

Scales it down to zero when idle (saving money)

Provides HTTPS, logging, security, and load balancing

With Cloud Run, you just provide the container image (or source code) and Google handles all the Kubernetes-type
components behind the scenes:

✅ Deployment

✅ Service

✅ Autoscaling / replicas

✅ Load balancing

✅ Revision rollout & rollback

✅ Networking & HTTPS

✅ Health checks

✅ Logs & metrics

gcloud run deploy --image gcr.io/PROJECT/APP
