Why do we need regions and zones, this helps for high availability and low latency, so even one of the region is down
the other picks up, and you can serve user with the nearest data center to them

It can also help with compliance reasons.  Zones are subsets of regions, each region have at least 3 zones, for fault
tolerance and fail over,each zone have 2 or more data centers in them, they can connect links to they have very low
latency.
