Instead of typying this all the time you can put it in a kube-config fike

~/.kube/config  # this is the part where the kubeconfig file should be in

kubectl get pods --kubeconfig /path/to/file


The kubeconfig file has 3 components
1. Clusters:
    This is the different kubernetes clusters you need access to, it could be prod, dev or staging cluster

2. Users:
    This is the users that needs to access the cluster, i.e myuser

3. Context:
    This maps the users to the cluster


kubectl config -h   # this will help get you all the necessary info you need
