In kubernetes we have servers and  components


Servers:
1. Kube-api server
    The users and other components like scheduler, kube-controller, tries to talk to the api-server

2. ETCD
    It stores the data, so kube-api updates the database of the etcd

3. Kubelet
    The kubelet allows the kube-api server to query the kubelet, to create pods and health of the pods running on
    each node

Clients:
1. Users
    They access the kube-api using the kubectl to make changes to the cluster

2. Kube-scheduler
    They access the kube-api server to allow it to schedule pods on nodes

3. Kube-controller-manager
    They talk to the kube-api to make sure a number of pods is running

4. Kube-api
    It talks to kubelet and etcd

5. Kube-proxy
    It talks to the kube-api




Check the path to the certificate in the static pods

/etc/kubernetes/manifests/

docker logs container id # to see the logs of the pods
