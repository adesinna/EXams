stat /path/item

This would let you see the inode of the item, this inode is where it is stored in the disk.

The hard link allows the file or item to be stored once and the other one points to it.

ln path/to/file /path/of/link # when you delete the file, the link still point to it in memory until everyone deletes their link

While soft link is a file that points to a path.

ln -s path/to/file /path/of/link # so when you delete the file the link does work
