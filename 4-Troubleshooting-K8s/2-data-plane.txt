Kubeproxy manages the service, and routes traffic to the pod with iptables, it runs as  a daemon set and routes traffic
to appropriate pods. If it is on different nodes, the cni plugins installed on each nodes helps with this.

The core dns allows name resolution in the cluster

Problem:
Worker nodes saying not ready


Solution
Describe the nodes

ssh into the worker node

systemcl status kubelet

journalctl -u kubelet

# swap is a virtual,
sudo swapoff /swapfile
swapon --show

rm -f /swappoff

/etc/cni/net.d/  # where the plugins should be


Problem:
svc is not reachable

kubectl run testpod --image=nginx --rm -it -- bash
ping svc
curl svc

test the kube-proxy too
