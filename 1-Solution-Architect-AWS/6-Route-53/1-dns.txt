DNS (Domain Name System) is a fundamental part of the internet that translates human-readable domain names
(like `www.example.com`) into machine-readable IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). This system allows users to access websites and services by typing simple names instead of remembering complex numerical addresses.

 Key Components of DNS
1. Domain Names: Hierarchical names used to identify resources on the internet (e.g., `example.com`).
2. IP Addresses: Numerical labels assigned to devices on a network, needed for communication.
3. DNS Servers:
   - Recursive Resolvers: Intermediaries that receive queries from client devices and fetch the corresponding IP addresses.
   - Root Servers: The first step in translating domain names, directing queries to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) servers.
   - TLD Servers: Responsible for the top-level domain (e.g., `.com`, `.org`) and direct queries to authoritative servers.
   - Authoritative Name Servers: Provide the definitive IP address for a given domain.

How DNS Works

1. A user types a domain name into a browser.
2. The query is sent to a recursive resolver.
3. If the resolver doesn't have the answer cached, it contacts a root server.
4. The root server directs the resolver to the appropriate TLD server.
5. The TLD server points to the domain's authoritative name server.
6. The authoritative server returns the corresponding IP address to the resolver.
7. The resolver passes the IP address back to the user's device, which uses it to connect to the destination server.

 Types of DNS Records
- A Record: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
- AAAA Record: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
- CNAME Record: Maps a domain to another domain name.
- MX Record: Specifies mail servers for a domain.
- TXT Record: Provides additional text information for a domain, often used for verification and security.

 Importance of DNS
- Simplifies access to websites and services.
- Provides scalability and redundancy.
- Supports security protocols like DNSSEC to prevent spoofing.
