Amazon Route 53 is a highly scalable and reliable Domain Name System (DNS)
web service provided by AWS. It connects user requests to internet applications
running in AWS or on-premises infrastructure.
The name "Route 53" comes from the fact that DNS typically uses port 53.


Alias record are only mapped to resources in aws

CNAME can map non-root domain to a root domain


Routing Policies

Simple Routing Policy:
    Route traffic to a single resource

Weighted Routing Policies

    You can decide the percentage of request should go to a particular
    instance based on their weight.

    It can do health checks too

Latency Based:
    This route it to the closest instance


Failover Policy:
    There would be a standy ec2 instance, if the health of the primary fails

Geolocation:
    Routes traffic based on user location and
    bias (optional adjustment to favor one location over another).
    A resource in us-east-1 and another in us-west-2, apply a 20% bias to us-east-1 to increase traffic routed there.


IP based Routing:
    Based on CIDR should route to an instance

Multivalue Answer Routing Policy:
Provides multiple health-checked IP addresses for DNS queries.
Useful for applications that need client-side load balancing
