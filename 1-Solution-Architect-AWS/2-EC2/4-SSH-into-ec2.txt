1. SSH with a .pem Key in AWS
When you launch an EC2 instance, AWS provides the option to download a .pem file (private key). Hereâ€™s how to use it:


chmod 400 my-key.pem
This ensures the private key is readable only by the file owner, as required by SSH.



ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@<Public-IP-or-DNS>

Replace my-key.pem with your private key file and <Public-IP-or-DNS> with the actual IP/DNS of your instance.

Default Usernames (Depending on the AMI):

Amazon Linux or RHEL:ec2-user
Ubuntu: ubuntu
CentOS: centos
SUSE: ec2-user
Debian: admin or root


2. SSH with your own keys

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f my-custom-key

cat my-custom-key.pub  # get the public key

Go to EC2 > Key Pairs > Create Key Pair > Import Key Pair > add the public key

ssh -i my-custom-key ec2-user@<Public-IP-or-DNS> # using the private key to authenticate


3. EC2 instance connect
