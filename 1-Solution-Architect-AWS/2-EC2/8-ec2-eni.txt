What is an ENI?
An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS. It represents a logical network adapter, including attributes like private IP addresses, public IP addresses, and associated security groups.

ENIs provide a way to manage networking for instances and support various use cases like load balancing, fault tolerance, and high availability.

Key Components of an ENI
Private IP Addresses:

Each ENI must have one primary private IP address.
Secondary private IP addresses can also be added.
Public IP Address (Optional):

If enabled, an Elastic IP (EIP) or auto-assigned public IP can be associated with the ENI for internet access.
MAC Address:

Each ENI has a unique MAC address, which ensures uniqueness at the hardware level.
Security Groups:

An ENI can be associated with one or more security groups, which control inbound and outbound traffic.
Elastic Load Balancing:

ENIs can be associated with Elastic Load Balancers for distributed workloads.
Network ACLs:

Traffic routed through an ENI is subject to Network Access Control List (NACL) rules.
Attach/Detach:

ENIs can be attached to or detached from instances dynamically, allowing flexibility in resource management.
Types of ENIs
Primary ENI:

Created by default when a new instance is launched.
Cannot be detached from the instance.
Secondary ENI:

Manually created and attached to an instance.
Can be detached from one instance and re-attached to another instance in the same AZ.
Use Cases
High Availability:

Attach secondary ENIs to a standby instance for quick failover.
If the primary instance fails, the secondary instance can take over traffic seamlessly.
Custom Networking:

Assign multiple ENIs with different security groups for instances running applications requiring separate traffic rules (e.g., web server and database server).
Elastic IP Management:

ENIs allow managing Elastic IPs separately from instances. You can associate an Elastic IP with an ENI and move the ENI between instances.
Monitoring and Isolation:

Use ENIs to separate traffic for monitoring purposes, such as logging or firewall rules.
Multiple Subnets or Networks:

Attach ENIs from different subnets to a single instance, enabling multi-network access.
Advantages of ENIs
Flexibility:

Attach/detach ENIs as needed, without restarting instances.
High Availability:

ENIs allow for quick recovery during instance failure.
Customizable:

Configure each ENI independently (e.g., private IPs, public IPs, security groups).
Scalability:

Use secondary ENIs for expanding traffic handling capabilities.
