This is how your ec2 instances are arranged

Types of Placement Groups

1. Cluster Placement Group:
Purpose: Optimized for low-latency, high-throughput workloads.

Placement: Instances are placed in close proximity within a single Availability Zone (AZ).

Use Case:

    High-performance computing (HPC).
    Applications requiring high-speed communication between instances.
    Big data workloads, like Hadoop clusters or machine learning training.

Advantages:

    Reduced network latency.
    Increased network bandwidth between instances.
Disadvantages:

    Risk of failure since all instances are in the same AZ.
    Limited capacityâ€”if the requested instance types are unavailable in the same AZ, placement may fail.


2. Spread Placement Group:
Purpose: Optimized for fault tolerance by spreading instances across multiple hardware racks.

Placement: Instances are placed on distinct underlying hardware, either within a single AZ or across multiple AZs.

Use Case:

    Applications requiring high availability.
    Workloads that must avoid simultaneous hardware failures, such as database clusters.

Advantages:

    Greater fault tolerance; hardware failure affects fewer instances.
    Useful for critical workloads.

Disadvantages:

    Increased network latency compared to cluster placement groups.
    Limited to a maximum of 7 running instances per AZ.


3. Partition Placement Group:
Purpose: Optimized for large-scale distributed applications with fault isolation.

Placement: Instances are divided into logical partitions, each placed on distinct hardware racks.
Multiple instances in the same partition share the same hardware.

Use Case:

    Big data processing frameworks like Apache Cassandra, HDFS, or Kafka.
    Applications that need fault isolation but also run a large number of instances.

Advantages:

    Fault isolation between partitions.
    Scalable for large workloads.

Disadvantages:

Higher latency between partitions compared to a cluster placement group.
