1. On-Demand Instances

Description:
    Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (depending on the instance type) with no upfront commitment.

Use Cases:
    Short-term workloads or unpredictable traffic.
    Development, testing, and proof-of-concept applications.
    Applications with spiky or unpredictable usage patterns.

Billing:
    Hourly or per-second basis (minimum of 60 seconds for Linux and Windows instances).


2. Reserved Instances (RI)

Description:
    Commit to a 1- or 3-year term to receive a significant discount (up to 75%) compared to On-Demand prices.

Types of RIs:
   - Standard Reserved Instances:
        Offer the highest discount for predictable workloads.
        Cannot be changed after purchase.
   - Convertible Reserved Instances:
        Allow you to change instance types or families within the same region.
        Offer slightly lower discounts compared to Standard RIs.

Use Cases:
    Steady-state or predictable workloads.
    Long-term projects with consistent compute requirements.
Billing:
Payment options:
    All Upfront (AU): Full payment at the start for maximum discount.
    Partial Upfront (PU): Partial payment upfront with reduced hourly costs.
    No Upfront (NU): Pay monthly, slightly higher cost.

3. Savings Plans

Description:
    Flexible pricing model that provides savings for compute usage (e.g., EC2, Fargate, Lambda) based on a commitment
    to a consistent usage amount ($/hour) for 1 or 3 years.

Types:
    Compute Savings Plans:
        Applies to all instance types, sizes, regions, and operating systems.
    EC2 Instance Savings Plans:
        Applies to specific instance families within a region.
        Less flexible but offers greater discounts.
Use Cases:
    For predictable workloads where flexibility in instance usage is required.
    If you want savings across multiple AWS services.


4. Spot Instances
Description:
    Purchase unused EC2 capacity at discounts of up to 90% compared to On-Demand prices.

Caveats:
    Instances can be interrupted by AWS with a 2-minute warning when capacity is needed.
    Not suitable for workloads requiring continuous availability.

Use Cases:
    Fault-tolerant and flexible workloads like big data processing, batch jobs, CI/CD pipelines, and stateless applications.
    Training machine learning models or rendering.

Billing:
    Pay for the duration the instance is running, based on the Spot price, which fluctuates.


5. Dedicated Hosts
Description:
    Physical servers dedicated to your use, giving you visibility and control over the placement of instances.

Use Cases:
    Regulatory requirements or software licensing (e.g., Bring Your Own License for Microsoft or Oracle).
    Enterprise environments requiring physical server isolation.

Billing:
    Pay per host (hourly, daily, or monthly).


6. Dedicated Instances
Description:
    Instances running on dedicated hardware but without the management capabilities of Dedicated Hosts.

Use Cases:
    Workloads requiring server isolation for compliance or licensing.

Billing:
    Per instance with additional charges for dedicated hardware.

7. Capacity Reservations
Description:
    Reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone for predictable workloads,
    ensuring instance availability when needed.

Use Cases:
    Applications requiring guaranteed capacity in a specific AZ.
    Disaster recovery planning.

Billing:
    Billed at On-Demand rates; can combine with Reserved Instances or Savings Plans for discounts.

On demand: I can come and book room at any time

Reserved: I want to book room for a long time, give me discount

Saving Plans: I want to spend certain amount per day for a period and stay in any room type

Spot Instance: Empty rooms I have to bid for, and I can get kicked out any time

Dedicated Host: I will keep this building for you

Dedicated Instance: I will keep these rooms for you

Capacity Reservation: Book a room, even if I no stay
