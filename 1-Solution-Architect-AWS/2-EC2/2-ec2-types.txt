AWS offers a variety of EC2 instance types to cater to different workloads, each optimized for specific use cases.
Instance types define the hardware resources available to your instance, including CPU, memory, storage, and networking.



1. General Purpose
- Purpose: Balanced compute, memory, and networking.
- Use Cases: Web servers, development and test environments, microservices, and small-to-medium databases.
- Examples:
  - T-series (e.g., t2, t3):
    - Burstable performance instances with baseline CPU performance.
    - Cost-effective for applications with variable workloads.
  - M-series (e.g., m5, m6i):
    - More consistent performance, suitable for a wide range of applications.



2. Compute Optimized
- Purpose: Optimized for compute-intensive applications.
- Use Cases: High-performance web servers, scientific modeling, batch processing, and media transcoding.
- Examples:
  - C-series (e.g., c5, c6g):
    - High CPU-to-memory ratio for compute-heavy tasks.



 3. Memory Optimized
- Purpose: Optimized for memory-intensive applications.
- Use Cases: In-memory databases (e.g., Redis), real-time big data processing, and high-performance databases.
- Examples:
  - R-series (e.g., r5, r6g):
    - High memory-to-CPU ratio for memory-intensive workloads.
  - X-series (e.g., x2idn, x2iedn):
    - Designed for extremely memory-intensive applications like SAP HANA.
  - u-series (e.g., u-12tb1.metal):
    - Ultra-high memory instances for enterprise-grade workloads.



4. Storage Optimized
- Purpose: High disk throughput and IOPS.
- Use Cases: Data warehousing, analytics, NoSQL databases, and big data processing.
- Examples:
  - I-series (e.g., i3, i4i):
    - Optimized for high IOPS with NVMe SSDs.
  - D-series (e.g., d3, d3en):
    - High disk throughput for distributed file systems and data processing.
  - H-series (e.g., h1):
    - Optimized for high sequential read/write access patterns.


5. Accelerated Computing
- Purpose: Use hardware accelerators (GPUs or FPGAs) for performance-intensive tasks.
- Use Cases: Machine learning, AI, graphics rendering, and scientific computing.
- Examples:
  - P-series (e.g., p3, p4):
    - GPU instances optimized for deep learning and AI workloads.
  - G-series (e.g., g4ad, g5):
    - Designed for graphics-intensive workloads.
  - F-series (e.g., f1):
    - Instances with FPGAs for customizable hardware acceleration.



6. High-Performance Computing (HPC)
- Purpose: Designed for high-performance computing applications.
- Use Cases: Scientific simulations, financial modeling, genomics, and other compute-intensive workloads.
- Examples:
  - Hpc-series:
    - Instances optimized for tightly coupled, high-bandwidth communication.

Instance Sizes
Each instance family offers multiple sizes (e.g., t3.micro, m5.large, c6g.xlarge). These sizes determine the allocated resources:
- vCPUs: Number of virtual CPUs.
- Memory: Amount of RAM.
- Networking: Bandwidth capacity.
- Storage: Attached storage capabilities.
