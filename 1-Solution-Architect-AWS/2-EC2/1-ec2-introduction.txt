This is an on demand virtual machine that you get from AWS, this is IAAS

You can pick the kind of machine you want, and run user script on launch,
there is options to set security group rules.

Instance State

In AWS, the lifecycle actions for instances relate primarily to EC2 instances.
Here's what each action means specifically in the context of AWS:


 1. Stop (EC2 Instance)
 What it does:
   Shuts down the instance, effectively stopping the operating system and powering off the instance.
   The instance's root volume and attached EBS volumes are retained, and data on them is preserved.
   The instance is no longer charged for compute (EC2 hours), but storage costs for the EBS volumes still apply.
 Behavior:
   The public IP address (unless an Elastic IP is used) is released and may change when the instance is restarted.
   Data in instance store volumes (ephemeral storage) is lost.


 2. Start (EC2 Instance)
 What it does:
   Powers on a previously stopped instance.
   The instance boots up from its attached root volume, and any data on EBS volumes is retained.
 Behavior:
   A new public IP address is assigned (unless using an Elastic IP).
   Charges for compute usage (EC2 hours) resume once the instance is running.


 3. Reboot
 What it does:
   Performs a soft reboot, restarting the operating system while the instance remains in the "running" state.
   Equivalent to running the `reboot` command from within the instance.
 Behavior:
   The instance retains its public and private IP addresses.
   EBS volumes remain attached, and no data is lost.
   Minimal downtime compared to stopping and starting an instance.


 4. Hibernate
 What it does:
   Pauses the instance and saves the contents of its memory (RAM) to the root EBS volume.
   The instance state is preserved, including the application state, data in memory, and private/public IP addresses.
 Behavior:
   When restarted, the instance resumes from where it left off.
   Supported only for specific instance types and OS configurations.
   Requires enough space on the root volume to store memory data.
 Charges:
   Storage charges for EBS apply, but no compute charges are incurred while hibernated.


 5. Terminate
 What it does:
   Permanently deletes the instance.
   By default, the root volume is deleted, but additional attached volumes can be preserved if configured.
   The instance store (ephemeral storage) data is lost.
 Use case:
   For cleaning up resources that are no longer needed to avoid incurring charges.
 Behavior:
   The instance cannot be restarted after termination.
   Associated resources like Elastic IP addresses are disassociated.


Comparison of Costs
| Action   | Compute Costs | Storage Costs (EBS) | Public IP Retention | Application State |

| Stop     | No            | Yes                 | No                  | Lost              |
| Start    | Yes           | Yes                 | No (unless Elastic IP)| N/A              |
| Reboot   | Yes           | Yes                 | Yes                 | Retained          |
| Hibernate| No            | Yes                 | Yes                 | Retained          |
| Terminate| No            | Optional (if kept)  | No                  | Lost              |

Understanding these actions allows you to optimize costs and manage the lifecycle of your EC2 instances effectively.
