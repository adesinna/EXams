 Public IP Address

    Definition:
        A public IP address is a globally unique identifier assigned to a device that connects to the internet.
        These addresses are routable on the global internet, meaning they allow devices to communicate directly with other
        devices anywhere in the world.

     Characteristics:
    1. Global Accessibility:
       - Devices with public IPs can be accessed directly over the internet. For example, web servers, email servers,
         and other internet-facing devices use public IPs to receive requests from users worldwide.

    2. Assigned by ISPs:
       - Public IPs are allocated by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to customers for use. They may be static
         (unchanging) or dynamic (changing periodically).

    3. Unique Across the Internet:
       - Each public IP is globally unique to avoid conflicts between devices on the internet.

    4. Address Range:
       - Public IP addresses are part of the IPv4 and IPv6 address spaces, except for ranges reserved for private use (detailed below).

     Example:
       - IPv4: 203.0.113.5
       - IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

     Use Cases:
    - Hosting websites and applications (e.g., www.example.com resolves to a public IP).
    - Allowing direct communication for services like video conferencing, remote desktop, or VoIP.



 Private IP Address

     Definition:
    A private IP address is an address used within private networks (e.g., homes, businesses, schools) to enable devices
    to communicate with each other without using the internet. Private IPs are not routable on the public internet.

     Characteristics:
    1. Internal Communication:
       - Private IPs enable communication between devices on the same network, such as printers, computers, and smart devices.

    2. Non-Unique Globally:
       - Private IPs can be reused in multiple networks because they are only meaningful within their specific local network.

    3. Address Range:
       - The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) reserves the following ranges for private use:
         - Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Large networks)
         - Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Medium-sized networks)
         - Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Small networks)

    4. Cannot Access the Internet Directly:
       - Private IPs require Network Address Translation (NAT), performed by a router or gateway, to communicate with public IPs on the internet.

     Example:
       - IPv4: 192.168.1.10, 10.0.0.5
       - IPv6: fd00::1 (Unique Local Address)

     Use Cases:
    - Internal LAN communication (e.g., file sharing, local web servers).
    - Private device connectivity (e.g., printers, IP cameras).
    - Isolated environments such as virtual private clouds (VPCs) in cloud computing.



 How They Work Together

 Private to Public Communication:
1. Device with Private IP Sends a Request:
   - For example, a laptop (192.168.1.5) in a home network wants to access www.google.com.

2. Router Uses NAT:
   - The router replaces the laptop's private IP with the router's public IP (e.g., 203.0.113.1) and forwards the request to the internet.

3. Internet Server Responds to the Public IP:
   - Google's server sends the response to the router's public IP.

4. Router Translates Back to Private IP:
   - The router matches the request and response, forwarding the response back to the laptop with its private IP.

 Benefits of Using Both:
- Private IPs Save Public Address Space:
   - With the limited IPv4 address space, using private IPs for internal networks reduces the need for public IPs.

- Security:
   - Devices with private IPs are hidden from the internet, reducing exposure to attacks.

- Flexibility:
   - Private IPs allow organizations to design their internal networks without conflicting with other networks.

| Feature                  | Public IP Address               | Private IP Address            |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Scope               | Global                          | Local                         |
| Accessibility       | Direct internet access          | Internal communication only   |
| Routable            | On the internet                 | Not routable on the internet  |
| Assigned by         | ISP or hosting provider         | Network administrator         |
| Unique Globally     | Yes                             | No (can be reused in different networks) |
| Example             | 203.0.113.5, 8.8.8.8        | 192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1     |
