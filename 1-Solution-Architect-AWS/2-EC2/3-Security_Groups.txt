These are rules on the traffic that is coming in and going out of your instance,
typically we have
- Outbound rules
- Inbound rules
- Ports
- Protocol

An instance can have multiple security group and a security group can have multiple instances,
these firewall rules are locked down to a vpc/region.

If you define a rule that allows a particular port for the security group X, all the
instance in the security group X enjoys that privilege.
