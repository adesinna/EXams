A lifecycle configuration is a set of rules applied to an S3 bucket. Each rule specifies actions such as
transitioning objects to a different storage class or expiring (deleting) objects after a certain period.


Key Features
Transition Actions:

    Automatically move objects to a lower-cost storage class as they age or become less frequently accessed.

Supported transitions include:

    From S3 Standard to S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, or S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
    From active storage classes to archival classes like S3 Glacier, S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, or S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

Expiration Actions:

    Automatically delete objects after a specified time to save storage costs or comply with data retention policies.
    Noncurrent Version Actions:

Manage old versions of objects if versioning is enabled by transitioning or expiring noncurrent (previous) versions.
Multipart Upload Cleanup:

Automatically remove incomplete multipart uploads to save costs.
Setting Up a Lifecycle Policy
A lifecycle configuration rule includes the following:

Filter: Defines the subset of objects the rule applies to, based on prefixes or tags.
Actions: Specifies what happens to the objects (e.g., transition, expiration).
Time Periods: Defines when the action occurs (e.g., after 30 days).
Example: A rule can transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier after 90 days and delete them after 365 days.

Use Cases
Cost Optimization:

Move infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage.
Automatically archive or delete data no longer needed.
Data Lifecycle Management:

Enforce data retention policies by expiring objects after a set period.
Regulatory Compliance:

Ensure that non-essential data is deleted after required retention periods.
Efficiency in Data Handling:

Automate management of large datasets with varying access patterns.
