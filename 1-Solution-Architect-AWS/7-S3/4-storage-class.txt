Amazon S3 storage classes are designed to provide cost-effective storage options
based on your data's access patterns and durability requirements.
Each storage class offers a different combination of cost, performance, and durability to suit specific use cases.


 1. S3 Standard
- Purpose: General-purpose storage for frequently accessed data.
- Features:
  - High durability (99.999999999% or "11 nines") and availability (99.99%).
  - Low latency and high throughput.
- Use Cases:
  - Active websites and applications.
  - Frequently accessed media files and big data analytics.


 2. S3 Intelligent-Tiering
- Purpose: Automatically optimizes costs by moving data between access tiers based on usage.
- Features:
  - Same durability and availability as S3 Standard.
  - Multiple tiers (Frequent Access, Infrequent Access, Archive, and Deep Archive).
  - Monitoring and automation fee applies.
- Use Cases:
  - Data with unknown or changing access patterns.
  - Long-term storage where cost optimization is needed.



 3. S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
- Purpose: For data that is accessed less frequently but still needs rapid access when required.
- Features:
  - Same durability as S3 Standard.
  - Lower storage costs but higher retrieval costs.
  - Minimum object size charge (128 KB) and a 30-day minimum storage duration.
- Use Cases:
  - Backups, disaster recovery, and long-term storage with occasional access.


 4. S3 One Zone-IA
- Purpose: Low-cost option for infrequently accessed data stored in a single Availability Zone.
- Features:
  - Lower durability (99.5% availability SLA).
  - Costs less than Standard-IA.
  - Not suitable for critical data or data that requires high durability.
- Use Cases:
  - Secondary copies of data or non-critical backups.

 5. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
- Purpose: For archival data that needs immediate access.
- Features:
  - Same durability as S3 Standard.
  - Low storage cost with slightly higher retrieval cost.
  - Minimum object size charge and 90-day minimum storage duration.
- Use Cases:
  - Long-term archives with occasional immediate access needs.



 6. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- Purpose: For archival data that can tolerate retrieval delays.
- Features:
  - Retrieval options: expedited (minutes), standard (3-5 hours), or bulk (5-12 hours).
  - Minimum storage duration of 90 days.
- Use Cases:
  - Backup archives and compliance data.



 7. S3 Glacier Deep Archive
- Purpose: For long-term archival with the lowest storage costs.
- Features:
  - Retrieval options: standard (12 hours) or bulk (48 hours).
  - Minimum storage duration of 180 days.
- Use Cases:
  - Regulatory archives and historical records.



 8. S3 Outposts
- Purpose: S3 storage on AWS Outposts, designed for data residency and latency-sensitive workloads.
- Features:
  - High durability and performance for on-premises use cases.
- Use Cases:
  - Applications requiring low latency or on-premises data storage.



How to Choose the Right Storage Class
- Frequent Access: S3 Standard or Intelligent-Tiering.
- Infrequent Access: S3 Standard-IA or One Zone-IA.
- Archival: S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval, Flexible Retrieval, or Deep Archive.
- On-Premises Needs: S3 Outposts.

Using the appropriate storage class helps optimize costs while maintaining the necessary performance and durability for your application.
