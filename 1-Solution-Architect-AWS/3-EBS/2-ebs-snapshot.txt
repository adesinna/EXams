What is an EBS Snapshot?
An EBS Snapshot is a point-in-time backup of an Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume. It is stored in Amazon S3 and provides a way to back up and restore EBS volumes. Snapshots capture only the blocks that have changed since the last snapshot, making them incremental and cost-efficient.

Snapshots can be used to:

- Restore data in case of failure.

- Create new EBS volumes in the same or a different Availability Zone (AZ) or region.

- Migrate volumes between regions.
