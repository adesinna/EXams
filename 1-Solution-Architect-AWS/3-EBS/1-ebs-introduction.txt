What is an EBS Volume?

An Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is a scalable, block-level storage service
provided by AWS. It is designed to be used with Amazon EC2 instances, providing persistent,
high-performance storage for applications and data.

EBS volumes function like virtual hard drives (since they are connected over the network that can be attached
to EC2 instances. They allow you to store data persistently, even if the instance is stopped
or terminated (depending on the volume type).

Characteristics of EBS Volumes

Block Storage:

EBS is block-level storage, meaning data is stored in fixed-size blocks, enabling low-latency access and
flexibility to run different types of applications like databases or file systems.

Persistent:

Data on an EBS volume persists independently of the lifecycle of an EC2 instance.
Customizable Size and Performance:

You can choose the size (1 GiB to 64 TiB) and performance characteristics (IOPS and throughput) to suit your workload.

Resilient:

EBS volumes are automatically replicated within their Availability Zone to protect against hardware failures.

Attach/Detach:

Volumes can be attached to or detached from EC2 instances dynamically.


You can choose to delete the EBS volume on termination of the ec2 instance




EBS Instance Store:

This has higher performance than block storage, because it is a physical hardware drive that is
connected to the instance.


Volume type

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides several types of storage volumes, each optimized for different use cases.
Here are the primary types of EBS volumes:

| Volume Type           | Use Case                        | Max IOPS/Volume        | Max Size  | Max Throughput/Volume  | Price     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|-----------|
| gp3               | General workloads              | 16,000                | 16 TiB    | 1,000 MiB/s            | Moderate  |
| gp2               | General workloads              | 16,000                | 16 TiB    | 250 MiB/s              | Moderate  |
| io1               | High-performance DBs           | 64,000                | 64 TiB    | 1,000 MiB/s            | High      |
| io2               | Critical DBs (higher durability)| 64,000                | 64 TiB    | 1,000 MiB/s            | Higher    |
| io2 Block Express | Massive, high-performance apps | 256,000               | 64 TiB    | 4,000 MiB/s            | Premium   |
| st1               | Big data/logs                  | 500                   | 16 TiB    | 500 MiB/s (burst)      | Low       |
| sc1               | Backup/archive                 | 250                   | 16 TiB    | 250 MiB/s (burst)      | Lowest    |

---

Key Takeaway:
- Choose gp3 for most applications requiring balance and flexibility.
- Use io1/io2 for high-performance database workloads and allows multiple instance attached to it
- Opt for st1 and sc1 for cost-effective storage of sequential or infrequent access data.



EBS Volume Encryption:

An encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume is an EBS volume that uses encryption to protect data at rest,
data in transit between the volume and its associated EC2 instance, and all snapshots created from the volume.
EBS encryption is based on AWS Key Management Service (KMS) and helps meet compliance and security requirements.
