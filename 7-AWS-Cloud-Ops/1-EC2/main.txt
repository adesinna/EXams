1. Changing Instance Type
Sometimes you want to do vertical scaling on your VM that is running on AWS, you can do this for a EBS backed instance.
You can change from a t2 to a t3 by stopping it first, then change instance type. This also preseves all the data in
the block storage (EBS Volume)


2. Placement Groups
This is how your instances are placed in AWS data center

i. Cluster
All the instances are close together within one AZ, this offers low latency. However, this is a single point of failure
if the zone goes down your application goes down.

ii. Spread
The instances are spread across AZs, typically 7 per AZ. They might not offer low latency like cluster but the avoids single
point of failure.  Limited to 7 instances per AZ

iii. Partition
Divides instances into logical partitions, each on separate hardware racks. Instances in one partition don't share
underlying hardware with instances in other partitions. Can have up to 7 partitions per AZ and hundreds of instances total.
