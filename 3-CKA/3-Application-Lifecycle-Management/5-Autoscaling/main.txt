Vertical scaling refers to increasing the capacity of a single machine (server) by adding more CPU, RAM, storage,
or processing power to handle higher workloads.

Horizontal scaling refers to adding more machines (nodes) to a system and distributing the workload across them.

Vertical Scaling vs. Horizontal Scaling

When scaling a system to handle increased load, you can choose between vertical scaling (scaling up) and horizontal scaling (scaling out). Here’s a breakdown of the differences:

| Feature          | Vertical Scaling                     | Horizontal Scaling                  |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Definition       | Adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to an existing machine. | Adding more machines/nodes to distribute the load. |


| Complexity       | Simpler (no need for distributed systems logic). | More complex (requires load balancing, distributed databases, etc.). |

| Cost             | Expensive (high-end hardware costs rise exponentially). | Cheaper (uses commodity hardware). |

| Performance      | Limited by the maximum hardware capacity. | Can scale almost infinitely by adding more nodes. |

| Single Point of Failure (SPOF) | Yes (if one server fails, the system goes down). | No (failure of one node doesn’t crash the system). |

| Downtime         | Requires downtime for upgrades. | Minimal downtime (nodes can be added/removed dynamically). |

| Use Cases        | Databases like MySQL (standalone), legacy applications. | Cloud-native apps, microservices, distributed databases (Cassandra, MongoDB). |


- Vertical Scaling: Best for small to medium workloads where simplicity is key.
- Horizontal Scaling: Best for large-scale, high-availability systems (e.g., cloud services, web apps).

Many modern systems use a hybrid approach (e.g., scaling vertically for databases and horizontally for web servers).

You can both scale workloads or infrastructure scaling in kubernetes.
We use cluster autoscaling for infrascture, and horizontal pod autoscaling and vertical pod autoscaling  for workload
