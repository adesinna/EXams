An Ingress in Kubernetes is an API object that defines HTTP/HTTPS routing rules to expose Services externally.
It requires an Ingress Controller (e.g., NGINX, Traefik, cloud-specific) that actually processes these rules.
The IngressClass specifies which controller should handle a given Ingress.
Example: ingressClassName: nginx ensures only the NGINX Ingress Controller enforces that resource.
Ingress supports host-based and path-based routing, SSL/TLS termination, rewrites, and redirects.
Unlike Services (Layer 4), Ingress works at Layer 7, enabling smarter traffic management.
In short: Ingress = rules, Ingress Controller = executor, IngressClass = mapping between them.
