The Gateway API in Kubernetes is a modern, flexible framework for managing how external traffic enters a cluster.
Developed by the Kubernetes SIG-Network group, it addresses the limitations of the traditional Ingress API by providing
a more expressive, extensible, and controller-agnostic approach to traffic management.
Unlike Ingress, which primarily supports HTTP and HTTPS traffic, the Gateway API accommodates multiple protocols,
including TCP and TLS, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

At its core, the Gateway API separates the responsibilities of gateway operators and application teams.
The GatewayClass resource defines the type of gateway and the controller that will manage it,
while the Gateway resource represents an actual instance with one or more listeners on specific ports and protocols.
Traffic routing is handled by route resources such as HTTPRoute, TCPRoute, and TLSRoute,
which specify how incoming requests should be forwarded to backend services.
This separation of concerns improves security, observability, and operational flexibility,
allowing network administrators to manage gateways without interfering with application-level routing.

Compared to Ingress, the Gateway API provides significant advantages. It supports multi-listener gateways,
allowing a single gateway to handle different ports and protocols simultaneously.
Routing rules are more advanced, enabling path, host, header, and method matching, as well as weighted traffic splitting.
It also supports multi-namespace routing, making it easier for large organizations with multiple
teams to manage traffic independently. Additionally, being controller-agnostic, it can integrate seamlessly
with service meshes and cloud provider solutions, providing a unified and scalable networking model.

In summary, the Gateway API represents the next-generation standard for Kubernetes ingress traffic.
Its flexibility, extensibility, and advanced routing capabilities make it far superior to the traditional Ingress API,
particularly in large-scale, multi-team, or multi-protocol environments. By decoupling gateway management
from application routing, it offers a robust, scalable solution for modern Kubernetes deployments.
