CNI stands for Container Network Interface. It's a specification and a set of libraries used to configure network
interfaces in Linux containers, primarily in Kubernetes and other container orchestration platforms.


ip addr
ip route
netstat -nlp

CNI in Kubernetes
Container Runtime must create network namespace
Identify network on the container must attach to
Container runtime to invoke network plugin(bridge) when container is added or deleted

* CNI = specification for container networking.
* CNI Plugins = actual implementations that set up networking, assign IPs, and manage connectivity.
* Kubernetes relies on these plugins to provide pod-to-pod, pod-to-service, and pod-to-external communication.


/opt/cni/bin # this is where the cni plugins are

/etc/cni/net.d  # this where the configuration is
