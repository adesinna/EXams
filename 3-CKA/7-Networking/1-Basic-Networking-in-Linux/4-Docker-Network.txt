When a container is created in docker, it creates a default network called bridge, there are others like host and none.
host connects to the host network, and none does not put it in any network.

docker run --network none nginx

# no one can reach the container



docker run --network host nginx

The container is connected to the host network, if you run a container on port 80, it automatically maps to port 80
on the host.

docker run --network bridge nginx

The default network

Every container get a namespace when created and are linked to the bridge network by default.
With port publishing you can access the container from the host.
