Suppose two linux systems with network card eth0 on each, how does the two systems communicate with each other,
they are connected to a switch. Suppose computer A with ip 192.168.1.10/24 and B with ip 192.168.1.11/24 are in a
network 192.168.1.0. They can communicate with each other if they are linked to a switch.

ip link # to the network face card

ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev eth0  # for computer A

ip addr add 192.168.1.11/24 dev eth0 # for computer B

Now both computer A and B can communicate with each other within the same network.

Although both system can communicate with each other, they can only do so in the same network, suppose they need to
communicate with another system C and D, in another network ?

This is where router comes in, a router allows two computers in two different network communicates, with each other,
the router would be connected to the two separate network so it get two ips assigned, one from each of the network.

Now the router is just another device on the network, to  make sure it knows where to forward this traffic to, it needs
a gateway.

What is a Router?
A router is a network device that:

Connects two or more different IP networks

Routes packets between them based on IP addresses

Maintains a routing table

May include additional features like DHCP, firewall, NAT, etc.

Example:
Connects your home LAN (192.168.1.0/24) to your ISPâ€™s network

Knows how to forward traffic to the internet or between local subnets

What is a Gateway?
A gateway is a more general concept:

It is any device that acts as an access point to another network

In IP networking, the term default gateway usually refers to the IP address of the router that devices send packets
to when the destination is outside their own subnet.
