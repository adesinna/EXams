Network Namespaces:
    These are should by containers to implement network isolation. As we know docker uses Namespaces to isolate containers
    and cgroups to control their resources.

    When you create a container its creates its own network namspace, as far as the container is concerned, it only sees
    the process within its own namespace. Although the underline host can access all the network namespace on it.

    See the host a hotel, it can enter any room in the hotel, however each guest only have his or her own key to their
    assigned to it. It is unware of the other rooms, only the host is aware of these rooms.



When a container is created it creates its own network namespace, it has its own route table. Just like the host have its
own interfaces. Now suppose you create two network namespaces, they can communicate by a virtual link, veth.

You can create a virtual switch instead, this is better than link. Since if they are numerous namespaces and connect
all the namespace to the switch. You can also add the host to this virtual switch via veth since its interface on the
host.

Now we can now use a router and localhost as gateway through the ip address asigned to the host on the virtual switch.
And with port forwarding you can reach the on the
