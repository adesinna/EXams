Suppose we set up Kubernetes nodes and can communicate with each other and no firewalls restriction. Now we have to
configure networking at the pod layer.

K8s doesnt come with a in built solution for pod networking but there is a layout in CNI
- Every pod should have an ip
- Every pod should be able to communicate with each other both on the same node and on the other nodes without a NAT.


/opt/cni/bin  # contains all the cni plugins


/etc/cni/net.d/ # contains the cni plugin currently being used
