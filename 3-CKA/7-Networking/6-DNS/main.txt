DNS in Kubernetes Cluster

Kubernetes deploys its own DNS cluster by default, whenever a service is created the kube DNS creates a record and
match its to the ip of the svc.

The kube DNS register the svc as:

Hostname Namespace Type   Root              IP

web       default   svc   cluster.local    10.107.37.188


So now the FQDN is

web.default.svc.cluster.local

The kube DNS register the pods as:

Hostname          Namespace  Type       Root              IP

10-244-2-5       default      pod   cluster.local    10.244.2.5


CORE DNS is the server, that is deployed in the cluster, it is deployed as deployment.

The core DNS is would be passed in the kubelet and also adds the ip and it names in the server
