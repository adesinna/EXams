Before we say what Kustomize is, let us consider this unique problem I have with my polomapp, we wrote the manifest
file for the dev env, and it contains specifications for the envs, however I need to rewrite for staging and prod, by
changing values at different level, example is the lb in the ingress, gateway apis and stuffs.

This is the problem Kustomize came to solve.

How does Kustomize work?

There would be a base directory and overlay for each envs where you customize for each envs

k8s/
    base/
        kustomization.yaml
        nginx-dep.yaml
        svc.yaml
        redis.yaml

    overlays/
        dev/
            kustomization.yaml
            config.yaml
        stg/
            kustomization.yaml
            config.yaml
        prod/
            kustomization.yaml
            config.yaml


kustomize build /k8s   # just shows what would happen


kubectl apply -k k8s/

kubectl delete -k k8s/



k8s/
    base/
        dir1/
        ...
        dirN/
In a case like this, put kustomization.yaml file and specific the resource, and list all the dir/ in the base
kustomization
