When designing a kubernetes cluster there are a lot of things to be considered, is it for productions, number of pods and
so on. for highly available cluster, you can have two master nodes or more. The kube-apiservers would have a load balancer
in front of them to distribute traffic. But the scheduler and controller would make one as leader elect, why the other
would be standby. The ETCD should be high available, the leader writes to the workers, they the workers must write
through the leader.

The best way to deploy for own is by using kubeadm.

We would follow the documentation for that.
