Suppose you want to update one of your nodes, there is a pod eviction time of 5 mins, if the pods is in a replica set
it would try to create it and schedule it on the other nodes, if not it would be evicted.

Best approach is to drain the node first, draining the node would move all workload to other nodes, this node becomes
cordoned (marked as unschedulable), when done you have to uncordon the node for it to be schedulable

kubectl drain  node_name   # step1

kubectl uncordon node_name # step 2 # make it schedule-able

If you just want to make it unschedulable without evicting the pods

kubectl cordon node_name # just makes the node unschedulable
