Suppose there is no master node in the cluster, the worker nodes can still use the kubelet to
create pods, these pods are called static pods, they are located in /etc/kubernetes/manifests,
the definition files for the pods are located here and if you delete the file the pod
also get deleted. You can only create pods this way, not other objects.
To know where this path is configured, it is passed as an option while running the service

--pod-manifest-path=/etc/kubernetes/manifests  or some path

Another alternative way is to pass in another file, using the config option
--config=pathconfig.yaml # this is different from kubeconfig file and its in the kubelet config file at /var/lib/kubelet
then pass this in the pathconfig.yaml file

staticPodPath: /somepath

Since there is no api-server, you cannot check or see this pod using kubectl, however if there is
a cluster, the kubeapi-server would still be able to see this pods in a read only mode, the kubelet
would create this static pods, but would mirror it for the kubeapi-server in read only mode.

Use case:
Since you cannot delete static pods using kubeapi-server, you can use it to deploy the control
plane itself as pods on nodes.

Systemd services: kubelet, container runtime
Static Pods: control-plane components (API server, etcd, controller-manager, scheduler)
DaemonSet Pods: kube-proxy, CoreDNS, CNI plugins
