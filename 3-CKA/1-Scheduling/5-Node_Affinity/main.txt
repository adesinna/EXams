1. requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution  #RDSIGS
This ensures that the pod is scheduled only on nodes that match the required labels at the time of scheduling.
However, once the pod is running, any changes to the node's labels won't affect it.

Key points:
Labels must exist on the node during scheduling.
If the node's labels change while the pod is running, it will keep running.

Example:
A pod can only run on nodes labeled zone=us-east-1.
If the label is removed after the pod starts, the pod remains on the node.


2. preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution
This defines a preference, not a hard requirement. The scheduler will try to place the pod on a node
with the specified labels if possible. If no such node exists, it will place the pod anywhere.

Key points:
Labels donâ€™t have to exist for the pod to be scheduled.
Like requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution, the pod will keep running even if the node's labels change.
Example:
A pod prefers nodes labeled zone=us-west-1. If no such nodes are available, the pod can run on any other node.

3. requiredDuringSchedulingRequiredDuringExecution
This enforces that the labels on the node must match both during scheduling and while the pod is running.
If the node's labels change and no longer match, the pod will be evicted.

Key points:
Labels must exist during scheduling and must remain present during execution.
If the labels change, the pod is kicked out of the node.
Example:
A pod must run on a node labeled disk=ssd. If the label changes to disk=hdd,
the pod will be evicted and rescheduled.
