Suppose there is no scheduler to schedule pods on the node, then you would need to manually
schedule it on the node, this is done by adding the field nodeName to the pod definition file.
When a pod is created the nodename can not just be added, there is always a binding object that
would be created for it to map the pod to the node.

If there is no scheduler the nodename name field would schedule the pod if it is specified while the
pod is being created but if it has being created you must create a binding object to binding it to a node
instead of using nodename.
