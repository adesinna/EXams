The pods are scheduled on the node by the default scheduler, however, you can have
your own customized scheduler with your own rules.
You can deploy the scheduler as a pod and pass the configuration into it as an arg,
in case there are multiple deployment you can make one the leader (master in db)

To assign a pod to the scheduler you specific the spec.schedulerName

To see which scheduler picked the pod up

kubectl get events -o wide

The default scheduler would have his own configuration file, and the additional
schedulers would have their own default names.

See an example

1. You create a custom scheduler-config.yaml file

2. Create your kubeconfig file for authentication into the cluster.

3. run the scheduler as a pod
