When pods are created they go through some phase before it schedules on a node

Scheduling Queue
    This queues the pod based on the priority set on the pods

Filtering
    This filter the possible nodes the node can be scheduled on

Scoring
    This scores the possible nodes and grades them based on resources free space

Binding
    This would bind the pod with the node that as the best score

They are plugins for each of the stages, they can be attached to the
extension points, pre and post

You can use on yaml file to configure profiles, to use different scheduler by using the scheduler name.
