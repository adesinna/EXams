Consider a simple wordpress manifest files, it could be complex and have so many moving paths. Suppose someone
package them into one repo and gives you flexibility with variables. This is what helm does, it sees all the objects as
a group.

helm install wordpress

helm upgrade wordpress  # after makes changes in the env

helm rollback wordpress

helm uninstall wordpress



Helm templates are the yaml files and values is the file variable file

helmchart = templates + values

helm install release-name chartname   # chartname are like image and release_name are like containers

How to use helm

helm repo add chart_url

helm install release-name chartname

helm install release-name chartname  --set key=value

helm install release-name chartname --values=values.yaml

helm pull # to use locally
