A security context is a set of security-related configurations that apply to a pod or container. These settings control:

Linux user/group IDs

Privilege escalation

Read-only file systems

SELinux, AppArmor, seccomp profiles

Capabilities (like NET_ADMIN, SYS_TIME)


You can set security contexts:

    At the Pod level: applies to all containers in the pod.

    At the Container level: overrides pod-level settings for that container.
