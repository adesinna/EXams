These are used for resources that are not bound to namespaces, like PV, Nodes, Clusters, use kubectl api-resource you
can know whether a resource is cluster or namespace.

We use cluster role and cluster role binding for objects like this. If you use cluster role and rolebinding for an object
that is namespace, then the effects would be for every namespace in the cluster.
