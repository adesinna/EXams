After a user authenticate into a cluster, there should be what they can do in a cluster, there would be different people
accessing the cluster and least privilege principle might be applied.


Authorization Modes:

Kubernetes supports multiple authorization modes, which can be enabled via the API server flag
--authorization-mode. You can enable more than one mode, and Kubernetes will check them in order.

| Mode                   | Description                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Node`                 | Grants permissions to kubelets for accessing API resources they manage |
| `AlwaysAllow`          | Allows all requests (not secure, mostly used for testing)              |
| `AlwaysDeny`           | Denies all requests (also only for testing)                            |
| `ABAC` (deprecated)    | Attribute-Based Access Control (uses policies defined in a JSON file)  |
| âœ… `RBAC` (most common) | Role-Based Access Control (recommended and widely used)                |
| `Webhook`              | External service handles authorization decisions                       |


RBAC would be considered going forward
