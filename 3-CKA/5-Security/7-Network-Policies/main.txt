In Kubernetes, ingress and egress refer to the flow of network traffic
to and from the cluster and between its components. These concepts are
critical for controlling and managing traffic in a Kubernetes cluster.
By default, all  pods allows all pods for both ingress and egress rules.

Network policies are objects, they are like security groups.
