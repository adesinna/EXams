Service accounts are used by bots to access the cluster, example an application can get the list of pods
in the cluster.

kubectl create sa name_sa

kubectl get sa

Whenever a service account is created, a token is also created but is created as a secrets token.

This token is used to access the cluster, even if the apps runs in the cluster, then you can mount as a volume in
the app pods.

For every namespace a default sa exists, when a pod is create the default sa token is always mounted to any pod created
in the namespace.

You cannot edit a pod with sa you have to delete, you can specific a service account in the pod definition.

In the new k8s you would need to create a token

kubectl create token sa_name
