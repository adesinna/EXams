Authentication is the securing access to the cluster, we would be discussing users access to the cluster, such as admins
and developers, bots using service accounts. Kubernetes does not manage users or create users, but only service
accounts.

The kubectl sends request to the API server, then the api server would authenticate and

Authentication Mechanism:

1. Static Password File
You can create a list of users and passwords in a csv file

password1,user1,u0001, group1  # you can optionally add groups
password2,user2,u0002
...
passwordN,userN,u000N


This file will now be passed as file to the kube-api-servet

--basic-auth-file=user-details.csv


2. Static Token file
It is similar to the password file but instead of password you can specific a token instead and also pass it as an option
to the kube-api-server

These two are not the recommended approach. Using TLS certificates is the recommended way.
