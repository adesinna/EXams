Whenever a user wants to authenticate into the cluster

kubectl get pods
    --server my-kube-cluster
    --client-key admin.key
    --client-certificate admin.crt
    --certificate-authority ca.crt
Instead of doing this we can move all these information into a config file called kubeconfig, k8s always file the file
at ~/.kube/config

It has 3 sections
- Clusters
    These are the different clusters you would like to access

- Users
    These are the different users that would like to connect to the clusters

- Contexts
    These links the cluster to the users



You can change current-context to whatever default you prefer (staging-context or prod-context).

This config can be used with kubectl --kubeconfig=/path/to/config.

kubectl config view # this shows the current config

kubectl config use-context user@cluster
