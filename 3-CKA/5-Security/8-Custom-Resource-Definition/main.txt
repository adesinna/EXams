When you create a deployment, pods are created and not just only that, replica set maintains the number of pods,
the deployment controller is responsible for this.

Custom resource definition allows us to create our own objects, even allows the object to create another object, just
like the way deployment creates pods.

Customer controller are written in programming language, it monitors the crd object and make changes and you can deploy
this controller as a pod or deployments in the k8s cluster!

Operator framework is just deploying both crd and controller code at the same time.
