In Kubernetes (k8s), API groups and versions help organize and evolve the cluster's RESTful API
in a structured and backward-compatible way. Here's a breakdown:


1. What are API Groups?

An API Group is a logical grouping of related Kubernetes resources. It helps separate core Kubernetes functionality
from extensions and experimental features.

Common API Groups:

| API Group                   | Description                                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `""` (core group)           | Core resources like `Pod`, `Service`, `Node`, etc.                    |
| `apps`                      | Workloads like `Deployment`, `StatefulSet`, `DaemonSet`               |
| `batch`                     | Batch jobs like `Job`, `CronJob`                                      |
| `autoscaling`               | Resources for scaling like `HorizontalPodAutoscaler`                  |
| `rbac.authorization.k8s.io` | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) resources like `Role`, `ClusterRole` |
| `apiextensions.k8s.io`      | For defining CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions)                       |
| `networking.k8s.io`         | Networking resources like `Ingress`, `NetworkPolicy`                  |



ðŸ”¹ 2. What are API Versions?

Each API group can have multiple versions, which indicate the maturity and stability of the resource definitions.

Common API Versions:

| Version    | Meaning                                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `v1`       | Stable; fully supported and safe for production use                 |
| `v1beta1`  | Beta; fairly stable but might still change (deprecated over time)   |
| `v1alpha1` | Alpha; experimental and subject to change or removal without notice |

Versions apply per group, so you'll see combinations like:

 `apps/v1` for `Deployment`
`batch/v1` for `Job`
`networking.k8s.io/v1` for `Ingress`

Use kubectl api-resources and kubectl api-versions to explore what's available.
